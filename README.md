## Description 📝:

Welcome to **DocChat-GitaSaar**, a unique project that combines machine learning, Shrimad Bhagavat Gita, and practical problem-solving. In this application, we leverage a machine learning model to teach the context of Shrimad Bhagavat Gita, providing insights and solutions to daily life problems through the wisdom of its slokas.

**Shrimad Bhagavad Gita**, a revered religious book in Hinduism, imparts profound teachings about life and living. Amidst the epic Mahabharata war, Arjuna faced a moral dilemma about fighting against his own family members. Shri Krishna, considered God in Hinduism, elucidated the essence of life and the path to righteous living, forming the essence of Shrimad Bhagavat Gita.
